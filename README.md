# Hi there üëã

I have a few online aliases like; BuffaLoBiff, Eli, Lyle, WaffleTheCool and Waffle. I am fairly new to programming, I've made a few discord bots that are no-longer in service but I am making Beat Saber mods for the ~~Oculus~~ Meta Quests. Here on my GitHub page you can throwaway projects and other stuff that I just made for fun :)))

### The mods I've made:

[DrinkWater](www.github.com/WaffleTheCool/DrinkWater)

[AniPic](www.github.com/WaffleTheCool/AniPic) (Modified version of Nya)

[Promotion Yeeter](/PromotionYeeter) (Later to be renamed to Adblock)

### Mods I've version bumped/made a little fix in:

Nya-quest

CustomMainMenu


Might have forgotten some stuff but thats me üëç
