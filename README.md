### Hi there 👋

I have a few online aliases like; BuffaLoBiff, Eli, Lyle, WaffleTheCool and Waffle. I am fairly new to programming, I've made a few discord bots that are no-longer in service but I am making Beat Saber mods for the ~~Oculus~~ Meta Quests. Here on my GitHub page you can throwaway projects and other stuff that I just made for fun :)))

The mods I've made:
DrinkWater
AniPic (Modified version of Nya)
Promotion Yeeter (Later to be renamed to Adblock)

Mods I've version bumped/made a little fix in:
Nya-quest
CustomMainMenu


Might have forgotten some stuff but thats me 👍
